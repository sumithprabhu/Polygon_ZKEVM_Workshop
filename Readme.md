# 🪴 Deploying basic voting smart contract over Polygon ZKEVM testnet


## Get Started 🏃🏻‍♂️

- Add ZKEVM testnet environment to your metamask [here](https://chainlist.org/chain/1442).

- Claim some Goerli token [here](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/).

Note: Provided faucet gives you eth based upon time, in current situation there is no other faucet available.

- Bridge assets from Goerli network to ZKEVM testnet [here](https://wallet.polygon.technology/zkEVM-Bridge/bridge)

Note : This would take some time.

- Copy the Voting.sol file from contracts folder [here]().

- Paste it into Remix IDE [here](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

- Deploy the contract under ZKEVM testnet , make sure there are enough tokens.

- Check the deployed contract over block explorer [here](https://testnet-zkevm.polygonscan.com/)

Woohoo! You have successfully deployed your first contract over Polygon ZKEVM 🥳
